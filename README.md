# Pos-Printer-Library

This is an Arduino library for a POS(point of sale) Printer.
This library is testet on a samsung SRP-350G printer.
These printers use TTL serial to communicate, 2 pins are required.
But can have rs-232 or other cards in the back, that convert othersignals to ttl, so you might need a soldering iron to add 2-3 wires.
